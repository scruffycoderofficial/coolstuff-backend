# Shopping List Demo #

This demo uses Docker to expose both the frontend and backend services. The frontend 
is built with Html, Css and JavaScript meanwhile the backend is built using PHP.

## Setting up the Solution ##

> It is assumed that the machine in which this solution would be deployed 
> has Docker Runtime support.

- Clone this repository into your designated workspace

- Run `docker-compose up -d` to bring up all services into life

- Once services are running then we need to execute command to create database 
  table(s) we will need for the backend
  
`docker exec -it coolstuff_api sh`

Once inside the container run `bin/console` (see sample output below).

```
$ bin/console
Shopping List Items 0.1.0

> The command to run in order to create the database table would be `migrations:migrate`.

Once all the steps above have been performed the frontend is ready for testing, or rather to be accessed.

## Accessing the frontend ##

If we run `docker-compose ps` we can see the list of all our services. Below is an example:

```
â”Œâ”€[MacBook-Pro][~/devhouse/assessments/racoon][master ðŸ˜±]
â””â”€â”€â•¼ docker-compose ps
        Name                      Command               State                     Ports
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
coolstuff_api          docker-php-entrypoint php-fpm    Up      9000/tcp
coolstuff_app          apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND         Up      0.0.0.0:9600->80/tcp
coolstuff_bes          /docker-entrypoint.sh ngin ...   Up      0.0.0.0:434->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9200->80/tcp
coolstuff_mysql        docker-entrypoint.sh mysqld      Up      0.0.0.0:6033->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp
coolstuff_phpmyadmin   /docker-entrypoint.sh apac ...   Up      0.0.0.0:8081->80/tcp
```
You can then visit `0.0.0.0:9600` to access the frontend and carry on testing.
